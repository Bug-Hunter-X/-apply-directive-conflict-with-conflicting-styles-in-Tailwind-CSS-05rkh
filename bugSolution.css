Instead of using `@apply` with conflicting classes, create a custom utility class that combines the desired styles without conflicts. This ensures that the styles are applied consistently and predictably. For example:

```css
/* bugSolution.css */
.text-red-blue {
  @apply text-red-500;
  /* Add other necessary styles here */
}
```

Use the new utility class in your HTML:

```html
<p class="text-red-blue">This text will be red.</p>
```
